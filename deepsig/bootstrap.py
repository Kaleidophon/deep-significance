    """
    Implementation of paired bootstrap test. A p-value is being estimated by comparing the mean of scores
    for two algorithms to the means of resampled populations, where `num_samples` determines the number of
    times we resample.

    The test is single-tailed, where we want to verify that the algorithm corresponding to `scores_a` is better than
    the one `scores_b` originated from.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores_a: ArrayLike
        Scores of algorithm A.
    scores_b: ArrayLike
        Scores of algorithm B.
    num_samples: int
        Number of bootstrap samples used for estimation.
    num_jobs: int
        Number of threads that bootstrap iterations are divided among.
    seed: Optional[int]
        Set seed for reproducibility purposes. Default is None (meaning no seed is used).

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Estimated p-value.
